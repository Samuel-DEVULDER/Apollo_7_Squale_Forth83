# Apollo_7_Squale_Forth83
Disassembly of Forth83 Compiler of Apollo-7 Squale computer

Result is available [here](asm/FORTH.asm)

# Rebuild
To rebuild the ASM just simply do:

> $ make all

in a unix-like environment (cygwin, mingw2, wsl, linux, etc).

It will fetch [OS_FORTH.imd](Makefile#L87-L94) from the internet, extract [FORTH.CMD](Makefile#L96-L98) and generate a flat [FORTH.BIN](Makefile#L100-L106) which will be decompiled by [F9DASM](f9dasm) using the [FORTH.info](Makefile#L65-L71) file generated by [FORTH.lua](script/FORTH.lua).

Then it will compile FORTH.asm using [A09](a09) and [compare the compiled binary)(Makefile#L77-L85) with the original one. They should be byte-identical.

# Clean

To quickly clean the decocompiled ASM and INFO file just do:

> $ make clean

To also clean the generated binaries (LuaJIT, f9dasm, a09, etc):

> $ make fullclean

and you should now have a perfectly clean folder just like you would have checked it out.
